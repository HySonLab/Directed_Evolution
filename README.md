## Installation

You should have Python 3.10 or higher. I highly recommend creating a virtual environment like conda. If so, run the below commands to install:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HySonLab/Directed_Evolution.git 
cd Directed_Evolution 

conda create -n mlde python=3.10 -y 
conda activate mlde

pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Training

To train the oracle (i.e., Attention1D) on certain dataset (e.g., AAV), simply run:
```shell
python train_decoder.py \
    --data_file /path/to/AAV.csv \
    --dataset_name AAV \
    --pretrained_encoder facebook/esm_t12_35M_UR5D \
    --dec_hidden_dim 1280 \
    --batch_size 256 \
    --ckpt_path /path/to/ckpt_to_continue_from \
    --devices 0 \
    --grad_accum_steps 1 \
    --lr 5e-5 \
    --num_epochs 50 \
    --num_ckpts 2 \
```
If you want to train the model without using WandB, just prepending `WANDB_DISABLED=True` to the command like below

```shell
WANDB_DISABLED=True python train_decoder.py ...
```

	abstract = {Directed evolution, a strategy for protein engineering, optimizes protein properties (i.e., fitness) by a rigorous and resource-intensive process of screening or selecting among a vast range of mutations. By conducting an in-silico screening of sequence properties, machine learning-guided directed evolution (MLDE) can expedite the optimization process and alleviate the experimental workload. In this work, we propose a general MLDE framework in which we apply recent advancements of Deep Learning in protein representation learning and protein property prediction to accelerate the searching and optimization processes. In particular, we introduce an optimization pipeline that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to pinpoint the mutation hotspots in the sequence and then suggest replacements to improve the overall fitness. Our experiments have shown the superior efficiency and efficacy of our proposed framework in the conditional protein generation, in comparision with traditional searching algorithms, diffusion models, and other generative models. We expect this work will shed a new light on not only protein engineering but also on solving combinatorial problems using data-driven methods.
